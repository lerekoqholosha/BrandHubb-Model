    <h2>Here are three reasons why a business may use this predictive model:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Optimization of Advertising Spend: By predicting the number of impressions that will be generated by a particular campaign based on the campaign type, media type, traffic source, and cost, businesses can optimize their advertising spend. This can help ensure that they allocate their budget efficiently and effectively to achieve their advertising goals.</li>
      <li>Data-Driven Decision Making: The predictive model provides a data-driven approach to advertising. By using data and statistical techniques, businesses can make informed decisions about their advertising strategy. This can help reduce the risk of relying on intuition or guesswork when making advertising decisions.</li>
      <li>Improved ROI: By using the predictive model, businesses can improve their return on investment (ROI). By optimizing their advertising spend and making data-driven decisions, they can generate more impressions and conversions with the same budget. This can help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their advertising efforts, ultimately leading to higher profits.</li>
