Problem Statement: Predicting Impressions from Digital Ad Campaigns

Your task is to build a linear regression model to predict the number of impressions generated by a digital ad campaign. You are given a dataset of previous campaigns, which includes information on the campaign type, media type, traffic source, and cost. Your goal is to use this data to build a model that can accurately predict the number of impressions that will be generated by a new campaign.

To solve this problem, you should first preprocess the data by converting the categorical features to numerical features. You should then select the relevant features and split the data into train and test sets. Finally, you should train a linear regression model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the test data. Once you have a satisfactory model, you can integrate it into a Flask app with a user interface that allows the user to input the relevant features and receive a prediction of the number of impressions that will be generated by the campaign.
