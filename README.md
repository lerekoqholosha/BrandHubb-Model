## Linear Regression Prediction Model for Advertising Impressions
This is a simple predictive model that uses linear regression to predict the number of impressions that will be generated by a particular advertising campaign based on the campaign type, media type, traffic source, and cost.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/BrandHubb-Model.git
`

### Prerequisites

.pandas

.scikit-learn

.flask

You can install these libraries using pip:

`pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn flask
`
### Installing
To install this project, simply clone the repository to your local machine and install the required libraries using pip.

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/BrandHubb-Model.git

cd BrandHubb-Model

pip install -r requirements.txt
`

### Usage
To use this project, you can simply run the app.py file and navigate to the URL displayed in the console.

`python app.py
or 
flask run
`

This will start a Flask web application that allows users to input the campaign type, media type, traffic source, and cost of their advertising campaign, and receive a predicted number of impressions.
